Examination Processing System

This is a basic Java program we made to help simulate how a university department might process exam results. 

The program works with 10 students. For each student, it asks you to input their name and student ID, and then it collects their marks for 5 different subjects. The marks are entered one at a time, and once all 5 are in, the program calculates the average score.

After calculating the average, the program assigns a grade based on the following grading system  similar to Strathmore University’s system:

A (70 and above) – Excellent

B (60 - 69) – Good

C (50 - 59) – Average

D (40 - 49) – Below Average

F (below 40) – Poor

Along with the grade, a simple recommendation or comment is added depending on the student’s performance. Everything is then shown in a simple report card on the screen. The report includes:

The student’s name

Student ID

All 5 subject marks

Average score

Grade

Comment (like Excellent, Good, Poor, etc.)

The current date when the report was viewed
